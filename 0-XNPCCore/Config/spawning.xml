Biome Spawning your Add On Pack Entities for The NPC Mod for V1.0
=================================================================
The NPC Mod is a community modding project that provides players with the means to release entity Add On Packs.
These can include zombies, NPC helpers, NPC hostiles, animals, and even mech types.
These Add On Packs are factional, and can help, hinder, or remain neutral towards players and each other.

=================================================================
Bringing your Add On Pack entities into Game
=================================================================
There are two primary mechanisms to bring your Add On Pack entities into game:

- Biome Spawning
NPC Mod entities can be spawned directly into the biomes in the same way as regular entities.
V1.0 places entities into their own unique spawning system (spawning.xml) which calls on their associated entity groups (entitygroups.xml).
This allows your Add On Pack to be added to the biomes as an additional spawning layer rather than competing with existing or custom spawning groups.
Biome spawning for the NPC Mod is identical to how it is performed for default game entities.
It closely resembles animal spawning groups that use 'none' as an entity to regulate appearances.
This ensures your Add On Pack entities remain the exception in comparison to regular zombies in order to enhance, rather than flood, the biomes.

- POI Sleeper Spawning
NPC Mod entities can be spawned directly into custom POIs. V1.0 allows POI sleeper groups and individuals to be added to POI sleeper volumes.
This spawning system is governed by game stages (gamestages.xml) which calls on game staged entity groups (entitygroups.xml).
Check the NPC Mod Prefab Pack Mod for more information on that.

This guide introduces just the Biome Spawning mechanism. Here are examples of how we can set up your Add On Pack entities for Biome Spawning.

=================================================================
Biome Spawning
=================================================================
Entities brought into the biomes (Pine Forest, Desert, etc.) are governed by spawning.xml and entitygroups.xml.

spawning.xml governs:
=================================================================
- Where the entities can appear (<append xpath="/spawning/biome[@name='pine_forest']"> allows entities to appear in the Pine Forest)
- How many entities will appear for each spawning instance (maxcount="1" allows a single entity to appear)
- How often they can reappear (respawndelay="1" allows entities to reappear every 60 minutes [Real Life minutes, not in game time])
- When they can appear (time="Day" allows entities to appear in the day time with "Night" and "Any" being other used options)
- Who can appear (entitygroup="XythSpiddiesDay" allows an entitygroups.xml group called "XythSpiddiesDay" to appear)
- Restrictions or special locations (notags="commercial,industrial,downtown" allows the entities to only appear away from POIs with these tags)

Here is a working example for the 1-NPCXSpiderColonyExpansionPack Add On Pack for the Pine Forest biome in spawning.xml.

	<append xpath="/spawning/biome[@name='pine_forest']">
		<spawn maxcount="1" respawndelay="1" time="Day" entitygroup="XythSpiddiesDay" notags="commercial,industrial,downtown" />
		<spawn maxcount="1" respawndelay="1" time="Night" entitygroup="XythSpiddiesNight" notags="commercial,industrial,downtown" />
		<spawn maxcount="1" respawndelay="3" time="Day" entitygroup="XythSpiddiesDay" tags="commercial,industrial" notags="downtown" />
		<spawn maxcount="1" respawndelay="3" time="Night" entitygroup="XythSpiddiesNight" tags="commercial,industrial" notags="downtown" />
		<spawn maxcount="1" respawndelay="3" time="Day" entitygroup="XythSpiddiesNight" tags="downtown" />
		<spawn maxcount="1" respawndelay="3" time="Night" entitygroup="XythSpiddiesNight" tags="downtown" />
	</append>

Based on the above criteria, this tells us that the XythSpiddiesDay entity group (entitygroups.xml) can appear in the Pine Forest biomes.

The last line tells us that 1 entity (maxcount="1") can respawn every 180 minutes (respawndelay="3") at Night (time="Night") Down Town (tags="downtown").
This 1 entity is pulled into the Pine Forest from XythSpiddiesNight entity group (entitygroup="XythSpiddiesNight").
It has a special restriction of only appearing around Down Town City POIs (tags="downtown").
This last lime limits respawning to 3 (180 minutes) because the default zombies will appear here in much greater amount and frequency over time.
Allowing just a token gesture appearance, if any at all, from the NPC Mod Add On Pack ensures it does not become overwhelmed with opposite factions and degrade server performance.

The above working example is comprehensive and covers all scenarios. This closely resembles a default spawning.xml entry for a particular biome.
If you wanted to be more generic and restrict to just the biome, it would be enough to use the following entry instead:

	<append xpath="/spawning/biome[@name='pine_forest']">
		<spawn maxcount="1" respawndelay="1" time="Any" entitygroup="WildernessRobotDronesAny" notags="commercial,industrial,downtown" />
	</append>
	
This allows 1 entity to appear in only the Pine Forest biome once every 60 minutes from WildernessRobotDronesAny entity group at any time of the day.
As the 'Wilderness Robot Done Any' name suggests, it is kept out of the POI tiling system for the most part.

entitygroups.xml governs:
=================================================================
- Exactly who can appear from a list
- How often they can be selected from a list
- How they will be throttled using a 'none' entity which staggers appearances of Add On Pack entities to ensure they don't flood the biomes.

Based on observational testing, an entity brought into the biomes from spawning.xml can spawn approximately every 40-50 blocks.
This is what we can generally observe for default zombies. This would be far too often for NPC Mod Add On Pack entities under normal circumstances.
We can regulate this by adding a 'none' entity at the bottom of the entity group list. This is already used in default animal entity groups.
	
Here is a working example for the 1-NPCXSpiderColonyExpansionPack Add On Pack for the XythSpiddiesDay group in entitygroups.xml.  -->

	<!-- Adding up to a total of 100 for conformity -->
	<!-- *** DAY -->
	
<!--<entitygroup name="XythSpiddiesDay">
		animalSpider01Mini, 1
		animalSpider02Mini, 1
		animalSpider03Mini, 1
		animalSpider01, 1
		animalSpider02, 1
		animalSpider03, 1
		animalSpider01Feral, .5
		animalSpider02Feral, .5
		animalSpider03Feral, .5
		animalSpider01Radiated, .3
		animalSpider02Radiated, .3
		animalSpider03Radiated, .3
		animalSpider01Queen, .2
		animalSpider02Queen, .2
		animalSpider03Queen, .2
		none, 91
	</entitygroup>
	
This entity group entry shows us the contents of the XythSpiddiesDay list. We can see the name of the entity along with its probability to be selected.
Since this group will appear in the Pine Forest in the Day, it is kept relatively calm with low HP mini spiders appearing more often than high HP queen spiders.
Notice how 'none, 91' appears at the bottom of the list. Ensure 'none' is never placed at the top as the game requires a regular entity to be placed there.
This allows it to understand the type of group. By default, 'none' is placed at the bottom. This can be observed in the default entitygroups.xml for animals.

Considerations:
- Keep 'none' at a minimum of 90. NPC Mod Core entities typically have a 'none' entity for 96 or higher and they are certainly not strangers in the biomes.
- Allow the sum total of all probabilites to equal 100. This is for good practice and compliance. A total over 100 will be normalize back to 100, but a total under will not.
- Be careful with spawning.xml maxcount on any value greater than 1. Allowing 2 to appear can noticably reduce the distance between appearances and flood the biomes.

=================================================================
SUMMARY
=================================================================
This method of allowing your NPC Mod Add On Pack entities to appear in the biomes allows us to layer on top, rather that replace.
It has been tested comprehensively and performs very effectively when carefully regulated.
By following the above recommendations and guidelines, your Add On Pack will remain balanced and complement multiple Add On Packs at the same time.
Refer to the default spawning.xml and entitygroups.xml for further explanations and examples since the game devs add explanatory comments in the code.
